	//to provide the specific implementation of method
	//method overriding is used to runtime polymorphism
	
	//Rules
	//-------
	//1. The method must have same name as declared in parent class
	//2. the method must have same parameters as declred in praent class
	//3. there must be parent and chaild relationship(inheritence)
	
	
	
	//if sub class or child class has same method has declared in parent class
	//it is known as method overriding
	
	//A static method can not be overridden.
	//main methods also we can't overridden
	//final method can not be overridden.
